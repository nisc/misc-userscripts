## Introduction

Welcome to the Misc Userscripts repository! This collection includes various user scripts designed to enhance your browser experience with useful functionality. These scripts are designed to work across different websites and browsers. **Please note that I am in no way affiliated with any of the websites or browsers these scripts are designed for.**

## Installation Instructions

1. Install a userscript manager like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)
2. Click on any script in the list below to install it, or manually add scripts using your userscript manager's "Install from URL" feature

These scripts have been tested with Firefox and Violentmonkey on macOS, but should work with other browsers and userscript managers as well.
